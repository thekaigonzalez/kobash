kobash official repository

For Unix-Like devices kobash utilizes your default shell if the utility isn't found by default.
Which means on Ubuntu, Debian, etc. you can get apt in Kobash, without the need for any ports.

It also uses a similar system to KTerminal, therefore the KTerminalPorts (core) Project is available.
